Maven Dependency Transfer Plugin
================================

This plugin allows transferring dependencies from some repositories to another.
While some repository managers already have such functionality, I was in need to copy
dependencies along with their POMs, their full dependencies and their parents to an internal repository by hand.
So I created this little helper to save some time.


Building
========

This is a standard Maven build. So use commands like 'mvn clean install' to get this plugin built and installed to your repository.
